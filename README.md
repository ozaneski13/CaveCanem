# Cave Canem

Cave Canem is a 3D Adventure game made with [Unity 2020.3.22](https://unity3d.com/unity/whats-new/2020.3.22). 
While doing it, I mostly followed [Brackeys](https://www.youtube.com/c/Brackeys) tutorials on Youtube.
I tried both URP and HDRP but since this game is for mobile and not that advanced, I sticked with Built-In Pipeline.

This game was a Master's Degree project for class named Development with Unity.
You can find my other Unity projects at my [GitHub page](https://github.com/ozaneski13).

Thank you for your contributions and your time.
